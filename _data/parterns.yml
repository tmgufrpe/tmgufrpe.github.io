  testimonial: "The Computer Science and Systems Laboratory (LIS e Laboratoire deInformatique et Systemes e UMR 7020) is a new structure resulting of the merge of two CNRS/University labs: the Laboratoire deInformatique Fondamentale de Marseille (LIF - UMR 7279) and the Laboratoire des Sciences de leInformation et des Systemes (LSIS - UMR 7296). LIS is a research lab (UMR) under the supervision of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientfique (CNRS), Aix-Marseille University and University of Toulon with the Ecole Centrale de Marseille (ECM) as a partner. LIS premises are located on the university campus of Saint-Jereme and Luminy in Marseille and on the campus of the University of Toulon. It comprises more than 375 members: 190 tenure researchers and professors, about 125 doctoral students and 40 post-docs and 20 technical staff. This new structure brings together the strengths and competences of the two LIF and LSIS laboratories, to meet new scientific challenges. In particular, our team works in collaboration with the Data Science Department at LIS on machine learning, natural language processing, data mining, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence LIS Research Partner: Prof. Bernard Espinasse https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/bernard.espinasse/biographie.html"

  title: Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse
  testimonial: "The Computer Science Research Institute of Toulouse (IRIT), one of the largest Mixed Research Unit (UMR 5505) at the national level, is one of the pillars of research in Occitanie with its 600 permanent and non-permanent members, and a hundred external collaborators. Due to its multi-supervisory nature (CNRS, Toulouse Universities), its scientific impact and its interactions with other fields, the laboratory constitutes one of the structuring forces of the IT landscape and its applications in the digital world, both in regional and national level. Our unit has been able, through its cutting-edge work and its dynamics, to define its identity and acquire undeniable visibility, while positioning itself at the heart of changes in local structures: University of Toulouse, as well as the various systems resulting from investments for the future (LabEx CIMI, IRT Saint-Exupéry, SAT TTT…).
