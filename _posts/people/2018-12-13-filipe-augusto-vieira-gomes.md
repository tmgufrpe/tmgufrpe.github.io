Projects: Analysing and Visualizing Controlled Vocabularies for AAC: an Empirical Study

Abstract:
Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Systems have as one
of its objectives help people with low cognitive functions learn how to
communicate with other people. To understand the meaning of a set of
words can help improve the communication abilities. A challenge in this
task is how to suggest a word based on the subject’s previous knowledge,
considering the meaning of an already known word to suggest a new one.
Also, we believe that a visualization method is needed to enhance the
vocabulary analyses. This work’s goal is to combine the Distributional
Semantics Theory with the Self Organizing Maps to provide visualization of
the semantic space of a controlled vocabulary that helps with the
suggestion of new words in an AAC system.
